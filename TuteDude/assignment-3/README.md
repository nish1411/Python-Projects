# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python 

## Functionality Overview

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

- **Functionality:** 
  - Input a number.
  - Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
  - Returns the calculated factorial.

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

- **Functionality:**
  - Input a number.
  - Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
  - Displays the calculated results.


Both programs are written in Python and require user input to function properly.
